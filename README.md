# tda-toolkit
My persistent homology related code. 
At the moment code release is planned until end of august. :) 


# Installation

The `pershombox` package is dependent on some third party software tools which I do not provide here.
Each of those dependencies yields an executable which you have to copy to 
`pershombox/_software_backends/ext_lib`.
Where to find the executables/sources and how to name the executable is listed below. 

1. `Dipha`: 
2. `Perseus`:
3. `Dionysus`?
